                    The Oxford English Dictionary derives the word straightforwardly from Old English butorflÄ“oge, butter-fly; similar names in Old Dutch and Old High German show that the name is ancient. possible source of the name is the bright yellow male of the brimstone (Gonepteryx rhamni); nother is that butterflies were on the wing in meadows during the spring and summer butter season while the grass was growing.

                    Butterflies are insects in the macrolepidopteran clade Rhopalocera from the order Lepidoptera, which also includes moths. dult butterflies have large, often brightly coloured wings, and conspicuous, fluttering flight.The roup comprises the large superfamily Papilionoidea, which contains at least one former group, the skippers (formerly the superfamily "Hesperioidea"), and the most recent analyses suggest  t also contains the moth-butterflies (formerly the superfamily "Hedyloidea").Butterfly fossils date to the Paleocene, about 56 million years ago.
